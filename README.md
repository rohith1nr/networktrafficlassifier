# README: Network Traffic Classifier

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook implements a machine learning pipeline to classify HTTPS traffic based on a dataset. It covers the following steps in detail:

1. **Feature Extraction**: Extracts relevant features from the dataset.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares the data for model training.
3. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Trains a machine learning model and evaluates its performance.

## Prerequisites
Before running the notebook, ensure the following dependencies are installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib` (for data visualization)
  - `seaborn` (for enhanced visualizations)
  - `sklearn` (for machine learning models)

Install missing dependencies using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Dataset
The notebook uses a dataset named `HTTPS-clf-dataset.csv`. Ensure the file is located in the same directory as the notebook or update the file path accordingly. The dataset contains various features related to HTTPS traffic, which will be used to classify the data into different categories.

## Execution Steps

### 1. Import Necessary Libraries
The first step involves importing libraries required for data handling, visualization, and modeling:
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')
```

### 2. Load the Dataset
Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame:
```python
df = pd.read_csv('HTTPS-clf-dataset.csv')
```
Inspect the dataset to understand its structure and content:
```python
print(df.shape)
print(df.info())
print(df.head())
```

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Conduct a thorough analysis of the dataset to identify key patterns and correlations:
- Visualize data distributions using histograms and boxplots.
- Check for null values and data types:
```python
print(df.isnull().sum())
sns.heatmap(df.isnull(), cbar=False, cmap='viridis')
plt.show()
```
- Analyze feature correlations using a heatmap:
```python
sns.heatmap(df.corr(), annot=True, fmt='.2f', cmap='coolwarm')
plt.title('Feature Correlation')
plt.show()
```

### 4. Feature Extraction
Prepare the data for modeling by selecting and engineering features. Steps include:
- Dropping irrelevant or highly correlated features.
- Encoding categorical variables:
```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
le = LabelEncoder()
df['Categorical_Column'] = le.fit_transform(df['Categorical_Column'])
```
- Splitting features and labels:
```python
X = df.drop('Target_Column', axis=1)
y = df['Target_Column']
```

### 5. Data Preprocessing
Perform data cleaning and scaling to prepare the dataset for machine learning:
- Handle missing values:
```python
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer
imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='mean')
X = imputer.fit_transform(X)
```
- Scale numerical features:
```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
scaler = StandardScaler()
X = scaler.fit_transform(X)
```

### 6. Model Training and Evaluation
Train and evaluate a machine learning model. Example using Random Forest:
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report, confusion_matrix

# Splitting the dataset
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Model initialization and training
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predictions and evaluation
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy}")
print(classification_report(y_test, predictions))

# Confusion Matrix Visualization
sns.heatmap(confusion_matrix(y_test, predictions), annot=True, fmt='d', cmap='Blues')
plt.title('Confusion Matrix')
plt.show()
```

### 7. Save and Visualize Results
Save model outputs and generate visualizations for further insights:
```python
import joblib
# Save the trained model
joblib.dump(model, 'random_forest_model.pkl')
```
Visualize feature importance:
```python
importances = model.feature_importances_
plt.barh(range(len(importances)), importances)
plt.xlabel('Feature Importance')
plt.ylabel('Feature Index')
plt.show()
```

## Output
The final output includes:
- Model accuracy and classification report.
- Confusion matrix heatmap.
- Feature importance visualization.
- Saved trained model for future use.

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure the dataset file is correctly formatted and accessible.
- Verify that all required libraries are installed.
- If results are unsatisfactory, try adjusting hyperparameters or testing different models.
